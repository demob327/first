    "What is a Recommendation System?\n",
    "If you use Netflix or Amazon you have already seen the results of recommendation systems – movie or item recommendations that fit your taste or needs. So, at its core a recommendation system is a statistical algorithm that computes similarities based on previous choices or features and recommends users which movie to watch or what else they might need to buy.\n",
    "\n",
    "How Does a Recommendation System Work?\n",
    "Assume that persons A and B like a movie M1 and person A also likes movie M2. Now, we can conclude that person B will also like movie M2 with a high probability. Well, that’s very little data and probably a rather imprecise prediction. Yet, it illustrates how collaborative filtering works. In a real world application we would need much more data to make good recommendations. The recommendation algorithms based this concept are called collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another popular way to recommend items is so called content-based filtering. Content-based filtering computes recommendations based on similarities of items or movies. In the case of movies we could look at different features like: genre, actors, … to compute similarity.\n",
    "If a user liked a given movie, the probability is high that the user will also like similar movies. Thus, it makes sense to recommend movies with a high similarity to those the user liked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing a Recommendation System\n",
    "If you want to understand the code below better, make sure to sign up for our free email course “Introduction to Pandas and Data Science” on our Email Academy. Throughout the course, we develop a recommendation system for movies. At its core, there is the method corrwith() from the Pandas library.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the final implementation of our recommendation system:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Download the MovieLens data set from: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/latest/\n",
    "How to Use Pandas corrwith() Method?\n",
    "The Pandas object DataFrame offers the method corrwith() which computes pairwise correlations between DataFrames or a DataFrame and a Series. With the parameter axis, you can either compute correlations along the rows or columns. Here is the complete signature, blue parameters are optional and have default values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The arguments in detail:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.) other: A Series or DataFrame with which to compute the correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.) axis: Pass 0 or ‘index’ to compute correlations column-wise, 1 or ‘columns’ for row-wise.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.) drop: Drop missing indices from result.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.) method: The algorithm used to compute the correlation. You can either choose from: ‘pearson’, ‘kendall’ or ‘spearman’ or implement your own algorithm. So, either you pass one of the three strings or a callable.\n",

    "\n",
    "Positive correlation:\n",
    "A positive correlation is a value in the range 0.0 < c <= 1.0. A correlation of 1.0 means that if the first variable moves up, the second one will also move up. This relationship is weaker if the correlation is lower than 1.0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative correlation:\n",
    "A negative correlation is a value in the range 0.0 > c >= -1.0. Negative correlation means that two variable have the opposite behaviour. So, if the first one moves up the second one moves down.\n",
    "\n",
    "Zero or no correlation:\n",
    "A correlation of zero means there is no relationship between the two variables. If the first variable moves up, the second one may do anything else."
