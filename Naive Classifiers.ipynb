    "Given a classification model, how do you know if the model has skill or not?\n",

    "This is a common question on every classification predictive modeling project. The answer is to compare the results of a given classifier model to a baseline or naive classifier model.\n",

    "Consider a simple two-class classification problem where the number of observations is not equal for each class (e.g. it is imbalanced) with 25 examples for class-0 and 75 examples for class-1. This problem can be used to consider different naive classifier models.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a model that randomly predicts class-0 or class-1 with equal probability. How would it perform?\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the expected performance using a simple probability model.\n",
    "P(yhat = y) = P(yhat = 0) * P(y = 0) + P(yhat = 1) * P(y = 1)\n",
    "We can plug in the occurrence of each class (0.25 and 0.75) and the predicted probability for each class (0.5 and 0.5) and estimate the performance of the model.\n",

    "P(yhat = y) = 0.5\n",
    "It turns out that this classifier is pretty poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, what if we consider predicting the majority class (class-1) every time? Again, we can plug in the predicted probabilities (0.0 and 1.0) and estimate the performance of the model.\n",
    "P(yhat = y) = 0.0 * 0.25 + 1.0 * 0.75\n",
    "P(yhat = y) = 0.75\n",
    "It turns out that this simple change results in a better naive classification model, and is perhaps the best naive classifier to use when classes are imbalanced.\n",
